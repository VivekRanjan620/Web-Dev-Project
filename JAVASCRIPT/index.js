//JAVASCRIPT
// JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. 
// A program such as C++ or Java needs to be compiled before it is run. 
// The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, 
// which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute.

//PROGRAMMING LANG:- HIGH LEVEL LANG & LOW LEVEL LANG 
//HIGH LEVEL LANG :-Some examples of high-level languages include Java, C++, COBOL, Pascal, Ruby, etc.
//LOW LEVEL LANG :- Some examples of low-level languages include the Machine language and Assembly language.(01001)



// In var re-declare and updation is possible
// var a = 11;
// var a = 13;
// console.log(a);

// In let updation is possible only
// let b = 12;
// b = 17;
// console.log(b);

// In Const cannot be re-declared or updated
// const c = 15;
// console.log(c);

// There are two types of scope in JavaScript.These are:-
//Global scope — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. 
// A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). 
// if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block.
//  A global variable has global scope.
//  A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.

//Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. 
//A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.

//let variableName = "A string"; //global scope
// if (condition) {
//     block of code to be executed  //local scope 
//     }
//     let anotherVariable = "something else"; //global scope

//DATA TYPES
// JavaScript has the following data types:

// Primitive Types:

// String
// Number
// BigInt
// Boolean
// Symbol
// Undefined
// Null

// Non-Primitive Types:

// Object (including Arrays, Functions, and other objects)

// let num = 20;
//  console.log(typeof(num));
